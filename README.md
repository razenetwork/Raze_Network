# Raze_Network
Raze network is a substrate-based cross-chain privacy-preserving payment protocol for the Polkadot ecosystem..
The Raze network applies zk-snark to the Zether framework to build a second-layer decentralized anonymous payment module. It will be then imported as a substrate-based smart contract. The goal of this contract is to enable the cross-chain privacy-preserving payment scheme for the Polkdot ecosystem.
