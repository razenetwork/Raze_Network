# Raze_Network
Raze network is a substrate-based cross-chain privacy-preserving payment protocol for the Polkadot ecosystem.. The Raze network applies zk-snark to the Zether framework to build a second-layer decentralized anonymous payment module. It will be then imported as a substrate-based smart contract. The goal of this contract is to enable the cross-chain privacy-preserving payment scheme for the Polkdot ecosystem.

Similar to the Zether framework, it will have three technical modules: mint, transfer and redeem. The mint module will convert any ERC-20 token into an anonymized version, while the redeem module will convert the anonymized token into its native form. The transfer module is the one that enables the anonymous transfer of the token.
